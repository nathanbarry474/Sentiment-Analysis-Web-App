# Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App
This is my first actual real project
I will make it so someone will be able to enter text into a text box, and it sends it to the back end and do SA on it and return the result. 
Eventually I plan on adding a database and an account system to where you can see all the texts (journal logs in the future case) you entered, their SA score, and the trends over time
